# Octree implementation using Morton codes

## Octree
Octree implementation is done using morton codes. The advantage of this approch is that the parent child relationships are in-built into the codes. Quick and effienct storage and retrival of information.

## Morton code
- xyz-codes are generated from real co-ordinates using 2-adic transformations. 
- Morton codes are then generated using interleaving bits of xyz-codes.
